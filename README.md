# IEEE_Orion_Image_Recognition

The objective of this Repository is to create Machine Learning code to recognize natural disasters such as oil in water, cracks in the ground (representing the earthquake)
and landslide given the disaster Image

The code "Convert image to pixels matrix.ipynb" converts images into pixel and create dataframes that has Crack images and noncrack images where the lines are the images and the columns are the pixels
